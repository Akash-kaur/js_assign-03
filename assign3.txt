CLOSURE
A Local variable is re-created every-time,whenever a function is called.
But when the function call,which created a Local variable, is inactive, then they defines a function, 
wrapvalue by which they were created. The ability to access a variable in an enclosing function is called Closure.

In other words, In Javascript, Objects and functions are also considered as variables.
A Function scope consists of different objects, functions or variables programmer have access to.
Some variables are declared inside the function called aas Local variables and they have local scope and accessed 
within the function only.
Global variables are declared outside the function as compared to local variables and have globale scope.
Global variables can become  Local variables with the help of Closure.
By using Jvascript Closure programmer can access the variable outside the function or even after the function is closed.

According to other research, when functions are declared inside the functions forming a chain of Lexical environment they are
known as Nested Functions . These functions can be accessed after the outer function is finished oroutside the Parent Scope.
Lexical Environmet stays in memory and can be changed and accessed.This process is called as Closure.
